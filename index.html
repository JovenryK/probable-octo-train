  <h2>El Nido</h2>
  <p>
    Perched in the region of Mimaropa, the islands of Palawan are one of the best places in the Philippines to explore. With the lost Crystal clear turquoise water I’ve seen, and a history spanning over 50,000 years, it’s an idyllic place to explore on your trip. Whilst in Palawan, make sure to visit El Nido which is perched on the most easterly part of the main island. Now, to get here, either take one of the larger planes from Manila (or Bohol etc) to  Puerto Princesa and then drive around 5-6 hours (depending on how crazily fast your driver goes) to get to El Nido itself.   </p>

  <h2>Cebu</h2>
  <p>
    Home to beach resorts and dive sites to boot the island of Cebu is an outdoor lovers playground. It really is one of the best places in the Philippines if you’re a bit of a water person. South-west of Cebu is the stunning Kawasan Falls, which is honestly one of the best places in the Philippines to see. Just make sure to take some waterproof shoes you can wear for a swim, the area can get rocky and quite slippy. Right down near the southern tip of Cebu, Tumalog waterfall is another great spot to visit if you’re in the south of the island. Just make sure to take some pesos for entrance fees.   </p>

  <h2>South Cotabato</h2>
  <p>
  South Cotabato is known by the locals as the “land of the dream weavers and is a great stop-off before venturing off to the more remote islands. It really is one of the best places in the Philippines to visit during a festival week, too. These run on multiple dates throughout the year and celebrate culture, music and island life. All with lots of street food and plenty of energy. Explore the lakes edges on foot, hop aboard a boat or fly above it on a zip line through the sky. Head to Seven Falls viewpoint to admire the waterfalls and jump on-board the zip line.</p>

  <h2>Bicol</h2>
  <p>
    With loads of white-sand beaches, crumbling caves and epic waterfalls, the region of Bicol is one of the best places in the Philippines to explore. That being said, the biggest attraction is the nearby Catanduanes Mountains, these beautiful formations rise from the ground and break into the sky, creating an iconic landscape. Especially around the Mayon Volcano.

  <h2>Boracay</h2>
  <p>
  Boracay is a relatively small island but has quickly become one of the best places in the Philippines to visit. That being said, recently, the government had to shut the island off from all visitors for over 6-months due rebuild the infrastructure on the island. Thankfully, the island has now reopened but there’s a number of measures that are now in place to manage visitor numbers more sustainably.

  <h2>Siargao</h2>
  <p>
  Siagro Island is home to some of the best swell in the world so, naturally, surfing is big deal here. Though, If you’re not a surfer, fear not, as the island has plenty of white sand beaches and coral lagoons to explore, snorkel or just laze about in. Siargao Island has some of the freshest seafood around. Head to La Carinderia and order the grilled prawns, you won’t be disappointed.
